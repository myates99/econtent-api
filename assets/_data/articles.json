Since the industrial revolution (mid-1800's), global temperatures have increased by an average of 1'C. To the average person, the difference of one or two degrees might not seem that big of a deal. So why is this significant? To heat the oceans, land masses, and the atmopshere by even one degree centigrade, enormous amounts of heat are required, and the impact on global climates will be major. For example, a decrease in 1-2'C has previously caused a Little Ice Age in the UK. If global temperatures continue to rise by more than 1.5'c, we will see wide spread coral bleaching and the destruction fo the Great Barrier Reef. Current estimated global temperatures are 1.2'C above pre-industrial levels."

However, fluctuations in temperatures between regions mean that this warming could be much greater in certain areas. Climate relates to weather which is far more unpredictable and localised. Fluctuations can be impacted by the time of day and seasons, as well as changes in the reflectivity of the Earth's surface (see A and F for more on Albedo effect and climate feedback), and changes in the concentration of greenhouse gases within the atmopshere."

So, what criteria is used to measure our emissions? The BEIS use what are called production-based emissions – so the emissions that the UK is responsible for producing, rather than those we consume. This could also be thought of as primary versus secondary emissions. The emissions included must also be territorial – that means anything produced within the UK no matter where the party responsible for these emissions are registered. That also means that UK companies who conduct business and produce emissions abroad, say through a factory, are discounted from predictions. Estimates also include the activities of people within the UK, both from British citizens and non-UK visitors. Finally, it includes land use within the UK – from peatland, to forests, to agriculture.

IAS emissions have increased by over 80% since 1990 and demand is likely to increase further. Poorly managed peatland is a large source of CO2 in the UK, responsible for emitting an estimated 23m tonnes in 2017. For context, that is only 5m tonnes less than the total amount of CO2 removed by all the vegetation in the UK.

It was the first such agreement between countries to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. It focused on the reduction of 6 key greenhouse gases. Each country had a different 'assigned amount' by which they had to reduce their emissions, based on their current emissions level and level of economic development - so less developed countries were allowed more emissions to enable them to develop."

Across all nations participating this would equate to a 5.2% cut in emissions between 1990 and 2012. As of 2013, 192 'parties' (or nations) had signed the Kyoto Protocol, though many of these had not ratified it (i.e. put it into policy) and not all who signed were assigned emissions targets."

Although legally binding, in reality there was little incentive for countries to comply. Many never ratified the agreement, including big emitters such as the USA, in part because they found it unfair that some other countries were not told to reduce their emissions. It didn't come into force until 2005 - by which point major emitters such as China and India had emerged, who had not been factored in and given emissions targets."

          "- The 2010 Cancun Amendments where 76 countries responsible for 85% of emissions signed voluntary pledges to cut emissions.",

If Biomass is going to work it requires a sustainable approach, meaning that the source is replaced after using.",
          "There are 2 main positives to 'doing' biomass sustainably. 1. It can be carbon-neutral: we convert biomass into energy by burning it. This emits carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, like fossil fuels. However - and this is the important bit - trees and plants have the potential to capture the same amount of carbon dioxide emitted through photosynthesis, meaning that any carbon made by the process is cancelled out by producing biomass. And 2. It hels us with waste management! When we use household waste as a biomass energy source, it avoids sitting in our bins and landfill. This plays a vital role in creating a circular economy of energy and waste. This means that we can design waste and pollution out of society by using it to be productive - making our energy!"

Due to the greenhouse effect (see G for more on that!), oceans are warming. If you remember anything from your school chemistry lessons, you might remember that heat caauses water to expand. This is exactly what's happening to our oceans, causing an increase in volume and producing higher sea levels.",
          "Increased melting of ice is to partially blame as well of course. Melting of icecaps from atmospheric warming and feedback mechanisms such as the albedo effect (check out F and A for the facts) contributes additional water to our oceans, some which has been locked in glaciers for many many years. Global warming is not a uniform process, and the arctic is heating at twice the rate of anywhere else on the planet. Greenlands glaciers pose the biggest threat to sea level rise, home to 2.96 million cubic kilometers of ice. It is important to not that melting sea ice does not directly contribute to rising sea levels. Just as a drink with ice in it will not overflow when the ice melts, sea ice is already accounted for in our ocean's volume. However, due to the albedo effect, melting sea ice reveals more dark ocean beneath it which will both absorb more solar energy, and contribute additional water that will expand as it heats."

Changing sea levels also risk the contamination of drinking water supplies - with porous aquifers absorbing the rising salt water. In Florida, limestone aquifers that provide drinking water to nearly 6 million people are increasingly polluted by salt water due to rising sea levels and unsustainable quantities of ground water being removed.",
          "There are many more impacts of sea level rise, from increased coastal erosion due to the loss of protective beaches; amplified storm surges with the power to be more destructive; and even the loss of habitat for fish and birds due to the loss of coastal habitats!",
          "So, as you can tell, sea level rise isn't going to be ideal. It's easy to start feeling anxious and overwhelmed about these impacts - trust me, we've all been there! But there are solutions, you can urge your local (and less local) officials to commit to mitigating and protecting against flooding. We also need to tackle the root cause - decreasing our greenhouse gas emissions and removing carbon dioxide and other harmful gases from our atmosphere. One effective solution that can also work to protect coastal areas are protecting and conserving wetlands and peatlands (areas where the remains of vegetation are compressed in waterlogged conditions). Peatlands have the potential of storing up to 550 gigatonnes of carbon - in fact they are the largest terrestrial store of carbon in the world! They have real potential to help with carbon removal, but damaged peatlands can contribute significant greenhouse gases. Championing for the preservation of our natural resources is one thing you can do if you want to help mitigate the flood risk of sea level rise, and contribute to tackling the climate crisis!"

Whilst this is a brilliant natural phenomenon, increased deforestation leads to this stored carbon being released back into the atmosphere. This is one reason why deforestation is so bad for the planet, by turning a natural carbon sink into a source of additional emissions.",

Staggeringly, the earth’s oceans have absorbed as much as 1/3rd of the CO2 that humans have produced since the start of the Industrial Revolution.

Expand your knowledge. Read and watch documentaries (Cowspiracy, Gamechangers, Forks over Knives and What the Health are some gems on Netflix).",
          "2) Realise that it's not a competition. For some, cutting out animal profucts is a big adjustment and it's important to remember that it will take time. You can start with cutting out a couple of things, leaving the hardest until last (for many this is cheese or chocolate!). That way, you can stagger the transition and ease yourself in.",
          "3) Learn about substitutes. There's so much fun to be had in the kitchen cooking vehan food as you have to be much more creative with ingrefients: who knew you could make cheese sauces from cashews or egg replacements from chickpea water (aka aquafaba... Trust us)!",
          "4) Get ready to read lots of labels! You would be surprised at the number of products milk can sneak into. But don't feel bad if you slip up. Remember that what you're doing is making a difference!",
          "5) Finally, remember to have fun. Veganism is a lifestyle built off a sense of compassion for the earth, so remember to be compassionate to yourself too. It can be overwhelming sometimes, and you may wish you could do more. Remember that there are hundreds of thousands of others feeling the same around the world making an impact as a collective consumer. Try out the vegan calculator to quantify your impact!"

Ice cores taken across locations in Antarctica and Greenland ice sheets contain ancient air bubbles trapped in the glaciers. Scientists can test these to determine concentrations of past greenhouse gases in comparison to those we measure today. These are called proxies for the understanding of past epochs. Scientists have shown that both the levels of present-day greenhouse gases and the rate of increase is anomalous in comparison to the past 800,000 years. Maximum methane levels reached 800 ppl over the past 650 thousand years, compared to present day levels of over 1800 ppl. CO2 levels in the late Quaternary ranged between approximately 170 to 300 ppm, in stark contrast to CO2 levels of 416 ppm recorded presently. Kopp et al (2009) claimed that a doubling of CO2 levels is enough to cause a 2 - 4.5 degree rise in climate sensitivity, stating that current levels are sufficient to produce a warming of 1.4 - 3.2 degrees increase in global temperatures.",

Different foods also incur different carbon footprints, do you know the average greenhouse gases in your lunch? We know there's a lot of information out there, and it gets pretty overwhelming. You can use the BBC's Climate Change Food Calculator to estimate the footprint of your plate (check out the references below!). Some examples are:",

          "When you shop at local butchers, bakers, farm shops and green grocers; it is likely that the majority of the produce has a shorter field-to-fork journey than large supermarkets, this incurs a much smaller carbon footprint. You will also be supporting your local economy and independent businesses. Research on spending shows that for every £1 spent with a small or medium-sized business, 63p stays within the local economy, compared to 40p for larger organisations. That's nearly one third more! Moreover, many farmers participating in local farmers' markets use organic non-GMO and chemical free methods to grow their own produce, and often use less plastic packaging also."

        "subheading": "Is it an affordable alternative?",
        "body": "Independent grocers often have a reputation of being a pricier alternative to supermarkets, and while some can't afford the discount bulk prices of supermarkets - they often have a lower mark-up rate on groceries. It's worth doing a bit go digging in your local area to see what your options are. Seasonal markets might also give you the opportunity to practice your haggling skills, or reduce prices towards the end of their opening hours to make sure all fresh produce gets bought and none is wasted. Independent and local food outlets will provide you with delicious seasonal produce grown locally, so you can be sure that your plate has a low carbon footprint."
