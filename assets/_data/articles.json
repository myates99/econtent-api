Absorbed sunlight is transformed into heat, which forms longer-wave radiation and does not pass as freely through greenhouse gases. Instead, most of this heat is re-radiated and warms the Earth.(Check out A for more on this!)"

However, industrial activities have resulted in the additional production of greenhouse gases, which have raised atmospheric CO2 levels from 280 to 412 parts per million in the last 150 years. The IPCC conclude that there is above a 95% probability that human production of these gases has resulted in increased temperatures (Look at Y for more detail)."

However, this cycle has remained consistent since 1750 and average energy output from the sun has not increased enough to account for the amount of warming experienced. "

Do you need to use the tumble dryer? Can you take a shorter shower? How much energy goes into producing the products you buy? Look at our post on Carbon offsetting for some ideas on how you can balance out your own carbon footprint. Remember, supply meets demand, a great way to tackle energy-intensive institutions (like fashion) is through taking your demand elsewhere!"
