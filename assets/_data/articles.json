The amended national goal of a 100% reduction in CO2e by 2050 relevant to 1990 will require emissions to fall at an average rate of 15 MtCO2e per year, the equivalent to 3% of total emissions in 2018.

So, what criteria is used to measure our emissions? The BEIS use what are called production-based emissions – so the emissions that the UK is responsible for producing, rather than those we consume. This could also be thought of as primary versus secondary emissions. The emissions included must also be territorial – that means anything produced within the UK no matter where the party responsible for these emissions are registered. That also means that UK companies who conduct business and produce emissions abroad, say through a factory, are discounted from predictions. Estimates also include the activities of people within the UK, both from British citizens and non-UK visitors. Finally, it includes land use within the UK – from peatland, to forests, to agriculture. ",

IAS emissions have increased by over 80% since 1990 and demand is likely to increase further. Poorly managed peatland is a large source of CO2 in the UK, responsible for emitting an estimated 23m tonnes in 2017. For context, that is only 5m tonnes less than the total amount of CO2 removed by all the vegetation in the UK.

As renters, we don’t have the ability to stick some solar panels on our roof – however, we can still run our homes with renewables. There are so many renewable energy companies out there, and many of them charge you less for the energy they supply than those who source their energy from fossil fuels. The link below will give you an insight into the many options out there. Just pop your landlord/lady/ estate agents and email and switch today. Many of the companies handle the switch for you, so it won’t take long – and you’ll be one step closer to making your own life, and the UK, a bit more carbon neutral.",

          "Each country had a different 'assigned amount' by which they had to reduce their emissions, based on their current emissions level and level of economic development - so less developed countries were allowed more emissions to enable them to develop."
